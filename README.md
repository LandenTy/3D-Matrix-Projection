# 3D-Matrix-Projection
This repository is dedicated to my goal of creating a working Orthagonal-Matrix 3D Projection Engine in PyGame using TechSmart.
I've accomplished the 3D Engine idea before using Visual Studio Code before but I've never been able to get it to work in TechSmart. (Yet)
I've been working around the clock since early December (5 Months Ago), and I'm attempting to get this Engine working! I began my
3-Demensional Adventure by creating a Sprite-Based 3D Engine, that relied on Player and Camera Positions to differentiate the sizes
of different objects. Then I moved on to GPU calculated Orthagonal Engines (What I'm working on now), and soon I'll be working on adding
shaders, lighting, shadows, and sounds!
