# 3D-Matrix-Projection : Update v0.0.2!
I've just completed automatic rotation about the Z-Axis with my Engine! I plan to add a wireframe, and filling functions
to use on the Quads, and I want to further explore other shapes. I think a triangle would be a good shape to start out
with. Next, I want to see if I can add shaders, and lighting! But those steps are for a later day. I've been working
around the clock since Early December, and I'm so so very proud to announce the bare-bones completion of this new Engine!

I've also been thinking about making a custom Multiplayer solution. If TechSmart had the ability to use the Sockets library,
I'd use that. But alas it doesn't, although it does have access to the Requests Library. So I may try to create a Multiplayer Engine
to go along-side my 3D Engine by sending back and fourth JSON Data Packets. With both the Server, and Computer making calculations
based on their own positions, as well as other player positions. I'm sure I'll make it work!
